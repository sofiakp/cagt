An alpha version of the code in the MATLAB programming language has just been released on Sept 11, 2012. The code is still a bit in flux and will be changing (mostly aesthetically) over the next month or so. So bear with us and continue updating your checked out SVN code to use the latest and greatest.

We will be attempting to provide a standalone version (that does not require MATLAB) in the near future.

**NOTE:** An early Python version of the code that was on this site had several critical bugs and has been deprecated. An updated python version will be released in the near future.

Click on the "Source" tab above to see download instructions. You will need to use the subversion versioning system (SVN) to download the code. SVN comes preinstalled on most unix/mac systems and if not its very easy to obtain it. On Windows, we recommend you use [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.net/) as its easy to use and integrates with explorer.

Use the following command to obtain the code.

svn checkout http://cagt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ cagt

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you read the **README** that is part of the code. Also check out the **Wiki** tab above as it has several useful installation and usage instructions as well as examples on how to use the code.
