==================== Installation ====================
The code consists of a set of matlab scripts. No installation is required.
The MATLAB code was developed using MATLAB R2011b. 
The R plotting code was developed using R versions 2.13-2.15 and requires the
ggplot2 and reshape libraries.
All the code was developed on 64-bit Linux.

The code should be compatible with older (but reasonably new) vesions 
of MATLAB and R and with other platforms, but we haven't tested it.

==================== Code structure ====================
clusterSignal runs CAGT clustering and writes the results in .mat files.
cagt is a wrapper function around clusterSignal that can also produce 
text output (including the output required to use the R plotting code).
If you're not very experienced with MATLAB, it is recommended to use cagt 
instead of calling clusterSignal directly.

simpleKmeans runs k-means or k-medians on a matrix.
hierarchicalClust gets a set of existing clusters and merges them using 
hierarchical agglomerative clustering, with optional "flipping" of mirrored
clusters.

writeTextResults writes the clustering results in a BED-like format.
makeSignalTable writes a text file with the mean signal and the signal percentiles
in all clusters. It can also compute the mean signal of other datasets
(i.e. not the one on which clustering was done) in the same set of clusters.
This is useful for studying the associations between different types of signals.

plot.cagt.multivariate.figs.R: Code for plotting the clustering results
with many customization options. See the wiki for output examples.

==================== Running the test code ====================
You can download test data from here:
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ensembl/encode/users/anshul/humanENCODE/cagt/src/testdata/
cagtDemo.m is a scipt that runs on the test data and demonstrates how to:
- extract the signal around a set of loci of interest to create the necessary
input file for cagt.
- call cagt to cluster the signal.
- make a multi-signal text file with the clusters and the signal of another
histone mark aggregated in each cluster.

plot.cagt.demo.R demonstrates how to plot the results using the output of 
cagtDemo.m.
